Udacity Android Developer NanoDegree Project
==================

Project Overview
-------------
Productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This involved finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

Why this Project?
-------------
As a working Android developer, we often need to create and implement apps where we are responsible for designing and planning the steps we need to take to create a production-ready app.

What I Learnt?

> - Use of MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
> - Handling of error cases in Android.
> - To add a widget to app.

> - Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

App Description
-------------
My task was to create an Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. I created an app that allowes a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
One of the skills I demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data.
